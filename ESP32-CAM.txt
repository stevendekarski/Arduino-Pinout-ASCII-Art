  Hardware:     ESP-32 CAM,
  Created:      2022/01/01
  Modified:     2022/01/01
  Language:     C++/Arduino
  Version:      1.0.0
  Author/s:     
  Licensing:    

  Notes:        Pin Function/IDE Pin Number, ~ PWM/I2C/1 Wire Pin, * = Pin is being used. Important: GPIO 0 needs to be connected to GND so that youâ€™re able to upload code.
                FLASH = Flashlight for the cam, note this gets very hot when left on.  A built-in red LED is on GPIO33.  VCC 3.3V/5V OUT is by default set to 3.3V BUT test first and can be change a jumper pad
